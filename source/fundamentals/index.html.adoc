== OpenShift Fundamentals

OpenShift is a container application platform that enables developers
and IT architects to design, build and deploy complex multi-component
applications.

Because the platform itself has a great deal of complexity, it is useful to
learn the fundamental concepts and features before embarking on the design of an
application. The fundamentals tutorials will provide a background on these
concepts. It will be useful to go through all of them before moving on to other
runtime-specific tutorials. It is also recommended to go through them in order.

Additionally, in going through these tutorials you will learn about and how to
use both the web console and the command line client.
